### Rock-Paper-Scissors

Game concept is pretty simple:  
You choose one of three items - rock, paper or scissors and we calculate computer choice using strategies, which we are picking randomly.

If your item "beats" computer's item - you are getting a point.  
If computer's beats your's - computer gets a point.  
If item's are the same - round draw.  
  
Game lasts till player or computer gets 3 points.  
  
Also you can add your score to database, if you want to.  
  
To start application you need to run 2 commands:  
1. Open command prompt in project directory and run `npm install` - to install packages.  
2. `npm run build` - to start server and build project.
Then you can move to dist directory and open built index.html  
  
If you want to open project in developer mode - you can use `npm run serve` command.
